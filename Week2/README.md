  <summary>caesar.c</summary>
  A program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher. Your program must
 accept a single command-line argument: a non-negative integer. Let’s call it
 k for the sake of discussion. If your program is executed without any
 command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your
 program should yell at the user and return a value of 1.
